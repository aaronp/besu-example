Please use the latest svelte5 approach, documented here https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/overview

Use svelte-ux (https://svelte-ux.techniq.dev/) and tailwind for styling.

Use svelte and typescript best practices. Keep things small, and use components where sensible to break up large pages.

Implement the server-side actions under the 'api' routes, and declare typescript types for request bodies and responses which are shared between the caller (client) and the server.
